# BOPDMD.jl
Scripts to call the BOp-DMD algorithm in Julia
For now, this is a standalone script, but I am hoping to integrate this code within the (DataDrivenDiffEq.jl)[https://docs.sciml.ai/DataDrivenDiffEq/stable/] and broader (SciML.jl) ecosystems, but I am a PhD student so this is not a top priority currently :)
